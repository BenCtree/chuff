# chuff

Give chuff a text file and it will perform Huffman encoding and decoding, printing the mapping from ascii characters to bytestrings, the encoded text, and the decoded text.

Quick Start:

Clone the repo to your machine, make sure gcc and make are installed then type:

$ make

To run, type:

$ ./chuff [my_text_file.txt]

For example:

$ ./chuff test.txt

![chuff_example](chuff_example.png?raw=true "Chuff Test Example")
